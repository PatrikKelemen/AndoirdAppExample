## Introduction

In this project we implemented an App for Android using Android Studio. The app developed was designed for walk-in 
clinics. The app had three different users, each with their own type of account, Admin, who runs the app,
Employee, who works at the clinics, and Patient, who visits the clinics. There is only one Admin account that is 
predefined in the database to have the username admin and the password 5T5ptQ. Both Employee and Patient accounts
can be created in the app. The set of screens and activities a user can do is determined by the type of account 
they have logged in with. An Admin can create, edit and delete services that all the clinics can choose from. They
can also delete Accounts of other users and clinics. Employees can create or join pre-existing clinics. They must 
be part of a clinic to do anything else. Once they are in a clinic they can choose services for the clinic too offer. 
They can also set their working hours and the clinics working hours. Patients can search for clinics by name, 
address, working hours, or services offered. Patients can then book an appointment and check in to that appointment. 
Once they've checked in to the appointment they can write a review for the clinic. Clinics show their appoximate 
waiting time and rating from patients.
